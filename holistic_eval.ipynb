    "# Part 7: Holistic Evaluation of LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final part of this series we look beyond individual metrics and tasks to consider **holistic evaluation**.  Real‑world language models must perform a variety of tasks—summarisation, translation, retrieval, code generation, and more—and must also be safe, fair and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook constructs a simple example of aggregating performance across multiple tasks, using simulated metrics for two models.  We compute an overall score and discuss what such aggregates can and cannot tell us."

    "In this example, **Model A** outperforms **Model B** on summarisation and retrieval, while **Model B** slightly edges out Model A on translation.  The models have comparable performance on code generation.\n",

    "- Difference: 0.013\n",
    "\n",
    "While such aggregates can be helpful, they hide important details.  Real holistic evaluations should also consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety and ethics:** Does the model avoid harmful or biased output?\n",
    "- **Fairness:** Do performance gaps exist across different languages, dialects, or user demographics?\n",
    "- **Robustness:** How does the model behave under adversarial or noisy inputs?\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Are results stable over time and across different datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "No single number can capture all aspects of a model’s performance.  A rigorous evaluation programme combines automatic metrics, human judgments, safety checks and domain‑specific assessments to build confidence in deployment.\n",
