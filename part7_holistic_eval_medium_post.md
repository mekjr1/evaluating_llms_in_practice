# Holistic Evaluation of LLMs â€“ Crossâ€‘Task Performance (PartÂ 7)

*Evaluating LLMs in Practice â€” PartÂ 7 of 7*

## ðŸ“¦ Recap

In the previous parts of this series we studied evaluation metrics for **summarisation** (BLEU/ROUGE), **perplexity**, **retrievalâ€‘augmented generation**, **A/B testing**, and **humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop feedback**.  Each of those methods provides useful signals about a modelâ€™s behaviour, but realâ€‘world systems must often tackle *many* tasks at once: summarising reports, translating instructions, answering retrieval queries, writing code, and more.  This final part looks at **holistic evaluation** â€“ aggregating performance across multiple tasks and metrics to form an overall picture.

## ðŸ§ª Simulated Crossâ€‘Task Experiment

To illustrate the idea, we simulated two models (**ModelÂ A** and **ModelÂ B**) on four common tasks.  Each task uses a different metric appropriate to that domain:

| Task             | Metric    | ModelÂ A | ModelÂ B |
|------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| Summarisation    | ROUGEâ€‘L  | 0.63  | 0.58  |
| Translation      | BLEU     | 0.47  | 0.49  |
| Retrieval        | nDCG     | 0.62  | 0.60  |
| Code generation  | Accuracy | 0.55  | 0.55  |

For each metric, higher values indicate better performance.  Notice that ModelÂ A outperforms ModelÂ B on summarisation and retrieval, ModelÂ B slightly edges out ModelÂ A on translation, and both models tie on code generation.

### Simple Aggregation

One way to obtain an overall score is to compute a **simple average** of the task scores.  Doing so yields:

- **ModelÂ A:** 0.568
- **ModelÂ B:** 0.555
- **Difference:** 0.013

This suggests that ModelÂ A is marginally better overall.  However, caution is warranted:

1. **Metric scales differ:** ROUGEâ€‘L values tend to be higher than BLEU or accuracy.  Weighting all metrics equally implicitly prioritises tasks with naturally higher scores.
2. **Hiding tradeâ€‘offs:** The aggregate hides the fact that ModelÂ B is slightly better at translation.  Decisionâ€‘makers should inspect perâ€‘task results.
3. **Beyond performance:** Holistic evaluation should also include **safety**, **fairness**, **bias**, **robustness**, and **efficiency**.  Our simple example doesnâ€™t cover these, but modern AI assessments must.

### Discussion

- **Taskâ€‘specific metrics matter.**  Itâ€™s important to choose the right metric for each task rather than forcing a single score across domains.
- **Aggregates are helpful but insufficient.**  Use them to get a highâ€‘level sense of performance, but always dive into individual tasks to understand strengths and weaknesses.
- **Human judgment remains critical.**  Automatic metrics donâ€™t capture whether a model is safe, helpful, or fair.  Humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop evaluation and redâ€‘team testing are essential.

## ðŸ”— Notebook

For full details, code, and the simulated dataset, see the companion notebook in the `partâ€‘7â€‘holistic_eval` folder of the GitHub repository.  The notebook loads the simulated metrics into a dataframe, computes the overall scores and differences, and discusses considerations for holistic assessment.

## âœ… Takeaways

Holistic evaluation is not just a simple average of numbers.  It is about balancing many factors: multiple tasks, varied metrics, fairness, safety, and human values.  As language models become more capable and are integrated into complex workflows, building **comprehensive evaluation pipelines** will be key to deploying them responsibly.
